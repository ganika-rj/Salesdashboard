# Salesdashboard (create using MS Excel)
I developed a project in Excel, creating dashboards and tables to analyze the data. A sales dashboard visually tracks key metrics like revenue, trends, and performance to support data-driven business decisions efficiently.
## Questions
- total sales?
- which city sales more?
- which month got the highest sales?
- highest selling category?
- which products got highest sales?

  ## process
  - verify data for any missing values and sort out the same.
  - Made sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data type, data format and values used.
  - created oivot tables according to the questions asked.
  - merge all pivot tables into one dashboard .
